Last updated post: no updates. 

As I started this project, I thought it was very interesting! I always coded in vanilla HTML and CSS (sometimes with some Javascript), so to start using the Astro framework was a bit of a challenge. I am still confused in some parts and would like to learn more in-depth about how it works (specially knowing that Hack Club has used Astro to build their amazing websites), so I'm committed to keep doing projects with this!

Another challenge was the API. However, the guides made it super easy to understand. I would love to explore more about APIs and even use more complex ones!

But other than my experience! I wanted to share the various resources I found that might be helpful - whether about catAPI, Astro, or even HTML and CSS. So, here they are!

- Styling: [CSS Flexbox Layout Guide] (https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) by Chris Coyier.
- Astro: [Build your first Astro Blog] (https://docs.astro.build/en/tutorial/0-introduction/) by Astro Docs.
- CatAPI: [Call your first API!] (https://108charlotte.github.io/APIs-Guide-Website/) by Sleepover and [TheCatAPI - Documentation Portal] (https://developers.thecatapi.com/view-account/ylX4blBYT9FaoVd6OhvR?report=bOoHBz-8t) by The Cat API.
- Post Formatting: [Markdown formatting guide] (https://www.range.co/help/article/markdown-formatting-guide) by Range.

_All of these articles are **not** mine, but I found them useful while creating this simple website_

I'm very happy with how far I got! I will create new posts about other useful sources I find! I do have some goals to update this website, but I will take it step by step.

Thank you! See you next time.

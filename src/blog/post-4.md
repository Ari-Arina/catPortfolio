As I started this project, I thought it was very interesting! I always coded in vanilla HTML and CSS (sometimes with some Javascript), so to start using the Astro framework was a bit of a challenge. I am still confused in some parts and would like to learn more in-depth about how it works (specially knowing that Hack Club has used Astro to build their amazing websites), so I'm committed to keep doing projects with this!

Another challenge was the API. However, the guides made it super easy to understand. I would love to explore more about APIs and even use more complex ones!

But other than my experience! I wanted to share the various resources I found that might be helpful (whether about catAPI, Astro, or even HTML and CSS). So, here they are!
